# Flux-for-everyone
Flux is a paid minecraft hacked client but you can get it free here.
all you need to do is extract flux.zip to a normal folder and then drag the folder into the versions folder.

(to reach the versions folder you need to hold the windows button and  r at the same time. then a little window pops up and you need to write %appdata% there press enter.
go into the .minecrfat folder and then find versions)

then go into minecraft launcher and press installations.
New.

but then go into versions and find release Flux.
the press create.
